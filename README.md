# Express.js Route Handler Error Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: insufficient error handling.  The `bug.js` file contains a route that fetches a user by ID.  However, it lacks robust error handling for cases where the ID is invalid or the user is not found.

The improved version, `bugSolution.js`, shows how to implement comprehensive error handling to provide more informative responses to clients and prevent unexpected behavior.

## Bug

The original route handler in `bug.js` attempts to parse the user ID and find the corresponding user.  If the user is not found or the ID is invalid, it sends a generic 404 response. This lacks helpful context for debugging.

## Solution

The solution in `bugSolution.js` adds the following improvements:

*   **Input validation:**  Checks if the userId is a number.
*   **Specific error responses:** Provides detailed error messages in the response body (e.g., 'User not found' or 'Invalid User ID').
*   **Appropriate status codes:** Uses HTTP status codes to indicate the type of error (e.g., 400 Bad Request for invalid input, 404 Not Found for missing user).

This more robust approach provides better feedback to clients and makes debugging significantly easier.
